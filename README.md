This is a multiplayer online game that needs at least 4 players. Currently, there are 10 rooms, each of which can host 4 players.

When 4 players join the room, the game starts. Till then, the hourglass timer will stare at you as time tick-tocks by.

The game contains 4 rounds; each round lasts for 10 seconds during which you can draw to your heart’s content. After 10 seconds, your drawing will be passed to the next player in the room who can then draw to their heart’s content. Meanwhile, you will receive another player’s drawing.

You get the idea. After 4 rounds of 10 seconds each, the 4 pictures will be tiled and displayed. Sorta like a quilt.

NOTE: The game is running on Heroku (https://quiet-oasis-04331.herokuapp.com/)
